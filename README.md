| LBAW | [GlintHub](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/LBAW) |In this project, we built a social platform that enables users to engage and connect through multiple channels and features.| 16.80 | HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Laravel, PostgreSQL |
| FSI | [Logbooks and CTFs](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/FSI) |This repository includes all the logbooks and CTF challenges completed throughout the semester| 20.00 | _ |
| MPSAC | [Control System-based application](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/MPSAC) |This project is control system-base application that is centered on energy optimization and use supervised learning. | 19.00 | Python, Jupyter Notebook |
| LCOM | [Space Invaders](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/LCOM) | Developed low-level drivers in C to support a Space Invaders-style game, handling input (buttons), graphics rendering (double buffering), timers, and collision detection. The system runs at 60 FPS using a state machine for game logic. | 14.80 | C |
| IA | [Wood Block](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/IA_1) | This AI-driven woodblock puzzle solver supports various search algorithmsâ€”Greedy Best-First, A*, BFS, DFS, and Iterative Deepeningâ€”and includes multi-level grids for testing and performance comparison. | 18.50 | Python |
| IA | [Loan Approval Prediction](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/IA_2) | Developed a binary classification model to predict loan default risk (repaid vs. defaulted) using an imbalanced dataset. Trained and tested the model to support improved lending decisions. | 18.00 | Python, Jupyter Notebook |
| CPD | [Parallel Computation](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/CPD_1) | Studied the behavior of parallel computation in a matrix multiplication problem using Java and C++. Optimized performance using OpenMP for parallelization and employed PAPI (Performance API) to measure and analyze hardware performance metrics, such as cache misses and FLOPs. | 16.70 | C++, Java, OpenMP |
| CPD | [Distributed Systems](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/CPD_2) | Developed a secure, concurrent, and fault-tolerant Java-based chatroom system with integrated large language model (LLM) capabilities for enhanced user interaction and intelligent message processing. | 18.00 | Java |
| COMP | [Java Compiler](https://github.com/Juliosantos04/COMP#) | Developed a working compiler for a simplified Java-like language targeting the JVM via Jasmin. Extended functionality from a base version, focusing on parsing, code generation, and language design. | 17.00 | Java |
